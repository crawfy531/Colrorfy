# Overview

This is a simple game made in GameMaker Studio in order to better understand game framework. In this game the character is a box that can change colors based on the user pressing certain keys. The box must navigate through the terrain while also running into other boxes that are of different colors. If the player box is of the complementary color to another box, than that other box will be destroyed. There are two rooms that the player box can go between. I found this project to be quite insightful on all of the logic that goes behind creating a game as well as some better knowledge on how to navigate through a game framework.

# Future Work

* make it so that the other boxes can move and attack the player
